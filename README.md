# fun-hello_world

This nutritional sauce demonstrates just how [disorderly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) functional can be.

Some comments have been sprinkled into the recipe.

Feel free to add any healthy ingredients; and write your name with the comments. ;)

## Compile âˆ§ Call

```bash
ghc fun-hello_world.hs && ./fun-hello_world
```
## Roadmap

One day Haskell will support this..?

```haskell
llap = "ðŸ–– live long and prosper"
```

One day Shyam will write his own language!..
